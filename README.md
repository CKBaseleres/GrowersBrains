A project built to solve the problems Gowers Globally are Facing.

Take a look at growersbrains.com

GrowersBrains is a app designed to bring expert growing techniques to everyone.Grow Green and Grow Clean.

GrowerBrains is a group project where everyone will get to levle up thier skillsets, get real world experience, learn all about the process of taking an app from idea to product, and have fun along the way.

The goal is to build GrowersBrians with react native.

The way that i came up with the idea is that i have 15 years expierience of growing plants i started in middle school holticulture class at 11 and am now 26 ive learned alot from books and the internet.But the place that i always learned the most from was other growers teaching me the techniques that took them years to develope and perfect.

That lead me to the idea of creating an app the brought a collective consciousness of Growers togheter to change the way the world grows.

Growing plants can be very expensive and can lead to great losses if not done properly. When done properly it can be a fun,exciting,and relaxing way to control the quality to the food or medicine that you are growing and ensure that it as clean and pure as possible.

The current design that i have for the app is to have eight different sections. 

Sections:
1)Welcome page that users would have to login to.
2)Growers Rankings- create rankings of the best growers in the world that could help people with one on one consulting.
3)Daily Grow- A daily picture of the plants a user is growing alwoing to keep an eye on the plants and make sure their healthy, allows to diagnose any problems that arise.
4)Greenhouse-"Whats in your Greenhouse" A locker of all the plants a person is growing and the data of what happens daily, once the plant is done growing a timelapse gets generated.
5)How to- Articles and videos from the top growers to teach every user the A to Z of growing.
6)Consulting- Alows top growers an oppurtunity to connect with new users to help them create a plan to make sure they optimze their grow and everything runs smoothly.
7)Competion- A daily, weekly, and monthly competion to see who the best grower is in many differnet categories.
8)Best products- Links and atricles reviewing the best products for growes to use all peer reviewed and approved. With affiliate codes included.

All of these features would allow for great data to be collected and machine learning to be created to diagnose plant problems, and make elite growing accesible to everyone no matter their expeirence levle.
